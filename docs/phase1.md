  1. Initialize Project: Set up a new React project using create-react-app with the TypeScript template.
   2. Install Dependencies: Add react-router-dom for navigation and react-dropzone for file uploads.
   3. Basic Routing: Create two pages, a HomePage and a ViewPage, and set up routes for / and /view.
   4. Build UI Components:
       * Hero Component: Design the main landing page section with a title and description.
       * Upload Component: Implement the react-dropzone functionality to accept PDF files, validate them by type
         (application/pdf) and size, and provide user feedback.
   5. Implement Logic: On successful file upload, the application state will be updated with the file object, and
      the user will be automatically navigated to the /view page.
